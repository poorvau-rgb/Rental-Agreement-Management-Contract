# Rental Agreement Management Contract

## 📌 Project Description
The **Rental Agreement Management Contract** is a blockchain-based solution that enables landlords and tenants to manage rental agreements securely and transparently. It helps automate agreement creation, rent payments, and agreement termination using Ethereum smart contracts.

## 🎯 Project Vision

## ⭐ Key Features
- **Create Rental Agreements:** Landlords can create agreements with monthly rent and security deposit details.
- **Pay Rent On-Chain:** Tenants can pay rent directly to landlords through the contract.
- **Terminate Agreements:** Either party can terminate the agreement securely.
- **Event Logging:** All key actions (creation, payment, termination) are logged on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add automated reminders for rent due dates.
- Implement late fee mechanisms.
- Enable dispute resolution via decentralized arbitration.
- Integrate with decentralized identity (DID) systems.
- Add escrow functionality for security deposits.
- Support off-chain document storage using IPFS.
